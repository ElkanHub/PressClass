## Generator

The current Generator should be a dropdown that has different generators under it. Each generator should have its own page, like what we have for the the assessment generator.

## implementing Lesson Plan Generator

THe lessosson plan generator should have its own page, like what we have for the the assessment generator and its own result page, since the result will have a different layout than the assessment result page.
IT should use the same GROQ API as the assessment generator.

The lesson plan generator should have the following features:
- input fields for the lesson plan generator
    - School Name{can be left blank}
    - Class
    - Subject
    - Strand(Topic)
    - Substrand(subtopic)
    - Date/Day{default to today's date + option to change the date}
    - Week of term + Term{example "Week 1 of Term 1"}
    - Duration{default to 1 hour + option to change the duration}
    -
- Layout of the lesson Plan on the result page{Core components}
1. School, Class, Subject, Date/Day, Duration, Week/Term
This section contains the basic administrative details for the lesson. It identifies the class level, subject, date of delivery, the specific school week or term, and the total duration allocated for the lesson. {Provided in the input fields}

2. Topic / Sub-topic
This outlines the exact focus of the lesson. It clearly states what is being taught — for example, a science concept such as Properties of Soil or an English language element like Nouns: Quantity and Units.{Provided in the input fields}

3. Objectives / Learning Outcomes / Performance Indicators
These are the specific abilities learners should demonstrate by the end of the lesson. Objectives must be tied directly to the curriculum and expressed using measurable action verbs such as identify, demonstrate, classify, explain, or construct. They capture knowledge, skills, attitudes, and competencies learners must acquire.{Generated by the API}

4. Relevant Previous Knowledge (R.P.K.) / Pre-requisites
Here, the teacher notes what learners are expected to already know before the new lesson begins. This ensures the teacher builds on earlier concepts and connects the new material to students’ existing understanding.{Generated by the API}

5. Teaching / Learning Materials (TLMs) / Resources
This section lists the teaching aids or resources required for effective delivery. These may include textbooks, charts, diagrams, flashcards, real objects (realia), digital media, chalkboard materials, or any tools needed for demonstrations or hands-on activities.{Generated by the API. Just provide either a list of what the teacher needs for the lesson or instruction on how to get them}

6. Lesson Stages / Phases (Activities / Procedure)
This is the core of the lesson plan and outlines, step by step, how the lesson will be taught. It usually includes:

Starter / Introduction / Warm-up — activities that engage learners, activate previous knowledge, and introduce the day’s topic.

New Learning / Development — the main teaching phase, which may involve explanations, demonstrations, examples, discussions, group work, experiments, or guided practice.

Reflection / Consolidation / Practice — activities that help learners apply or reinforce the new concepts, such as exercises, collaborative tasks, or reflective questions.

7. Core Points / Key Concepts
These are the essential ideas, facts, and principles that learners must understand by the end of the lesson. This section helps the teacher maintain focus on what truly matters.

8. Evaluation / Assessment / Exercises
This section outlines how the teacher will determine whether learning objectives have been achieved. It may include oral questioning, quizzes, written exercises, classwork, homework, practical demonstrations, projects, or other assessment tasks. The evaluation must directly align with the stated objectives.{Provide a generate assessment button will generate the appropriate assessment for the lesson. It should carry the needed information to generate the assessment. The assessment should generate asynchronously and provide the notiication that assessment ready. It should auto save to the dashboard.}

- Actions on the result page
The result page should allow the teacher to :
    - Download the lesson plan as a PDF
    - Generate an assessment for the lesson
    - Save the lesson plan to the dashboard
    - Print the lesson plan
    Note that the assesment generated whiles viewing the lesson plan should be asynchrounous and auto saved to the dashboard then alert the user. Utilize the notifications feature in the app and show a blue or red bagde on the bell icon to notify the user for better Ux.

The user should be able to view the lesson plan from the dashboard. There should be a seperate section for the lesson plans and a total lesson plans count at the top like that of the assessments. They should be able to peform all CRUD operations on the lesson plan from the dashboard.

## Important 
Make sure to secure implement this in accordance to the flow and plan of the app.
