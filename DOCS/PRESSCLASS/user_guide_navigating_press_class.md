# User Guide: Navigating PressClass

## Getting Started

PressClass AI is designed to feel intuitive from the very first login. Every element of the interface is built around one principle: **clarity without clutter**. Whether you are a teacher managing multiple classes or a student organizing study materials, the platform guides you naturally toward what matters most.

Once you sign in, you are welcomed by the **Dashboard**—your operational command center.

## The Dashboard

The Dashboard serves as your central hub within PressClass AI. It provides a high-level overview of your academic activity while offering quick access to essential tools and resources.

From the Dashboard, you can:

- View upcoming classes, deadlines, and academic events through the integrated calendar  
- Access recently created or edited files without navigating through menus  
- Monitor quick activity statistics that reflect your recent usage and productivity  

This overview helps you stay oriented and reduces the mental load of switching between tasks.
