## Users Under the Applicable Age Threshold

For users under the age of **[13]** (or the applicable age defined by local law), additional safeguards apply.

### Parental or School Consent

Account creation for minors requires **verifiable parental consent or authorization from a school or educational institution**. This ensures that guardians and schools are aware of and approve platform usage.

### Data Collection for Students

PressClass AI minimizes data collection for student accounts. We:

- Collect only information necessary to provide educational services  
- Do not build advertising profiles based on student data  
- Do not sell student data under any circumstances

---

### Content Filtering and Safety Controls

Student accounts operate under **enhanced safety and content filters**. These controls are designed to prevent the generation or exposure to:

- Inappropriate or explicit material  
- Harmful or abusive language  
- Content that encourages unsafe behavior

Filters are continuously updated to improve effectiveness.

### Reporting and Support Mechanisms

Students, parents, and guardians can report concerns directly using the **“Report” button** available on content pages.

Reports are reviewed promptly, and appropriate action is taken when necessary.
