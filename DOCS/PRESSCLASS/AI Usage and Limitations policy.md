# AI Usage & Limitations Policy

## Purpose of This Policy

This policy outlines how artificial intelligence is used within PressClass AI, as well as the known limitations and responsibilities associated with AI‑generated educational content. The goal is to ensure transparency, responsible use, and informed decision‑making by educators, students, and institutions.

PressClass AI is built to **support learning and teaching**, not to replace professional expertise, curriculum authorities, or human judgment.

## How PressClass Uses AI

PressClass AI uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to generate text‑based educational content such as lesson plans, structured notes, assessments, and study guides. These models are designed to understand prompts, instructional goals, and academic structure, enabling rapid content generation across subjects and grade levels.

In addition to LLMs, PressClass AI implements a **Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach. This means the AI does not rely solely on its internal training data. Instead, it can retrieve relevant, pre‑curated educational materials—such as curriculum frameworks and approved standards—and use them as context when generating responses.

This combined approach helps:

* Improve relevance to specific curricula
* Reduce incorrect or generic outputs
* Anchor responses to trusted educational sources

*(Placeholder: Insert details on knowledge sources, curriculum repositories, or update mechanisms.)*

## Known Limitations of AI

While PressClass AI is designed to be helpful and reliable, users should be aware of the inherent limitations of current AI technology.

### Accuracy and Reliability

AI systems can occasionally produce information that is incorrect, incomplete, or misleading—commonly referred to as *hallucinations*. This may include:

* Incorrect facts or explanations
* Outdated information
* Errors in dates, figures, or definitions

Users are strongly encouraged to **verify facts, examples, and assessments** before classroom or academic use.

---

### Bias and Representation

Although safety measures and content filters are implemented, AI models may reflect **biases present in training data or source materials**. These biases can appear in:

* Examples used in explanations
* Cultural or contextual assumptions
* Language tone or framing

PressClass AI actively works to minimize bias, but complete neutrality cannot be guaranteed. Educators should review content with cultural sensitivity and inclusivity in mind.

---

### Contextual Understanding

AI systems do not fully understand the **unique emotional, social, or situational context** of individual classrooms or learners. This includes factors such as:

* Student emotional well‑being
* Classroom dynamics
* School‑specific policies or constraints

As a result, AI‑generated content should always be adapted to fit the real‑world context in which it will be used.

---

## User Responsibility

By using PressClass AI, users acknowledge and accept that the platform is a **supportive tool**, not an authoritative source.

Users are responsible for:

* Reviewing all AI‑generated content before use
* Ensuring alignment with approved curriculum standards
* Applying professional judgment and institutional guidelines

Teachers, schools, and institutions remain fully accountable for instructional decisions, assessments, and learning outcomes.

---

## Appropriate Use Guidelines

PressClass AI is intended for **ethical and responsible educational use**. It should not be used to:

* Replace professional teaching judgment
* Misrepresent authorship of student work
* Circumvent academic integrity policies

Students are expected to use PressClass AI as a learning aid, not as a substitute for independent thinking or original work.

*(Placeholder: Insert academic integrity policies or institutional enforcement mechanisms.)*

---

## Continuous Improvement

AI technology evolves rapidly. PressClass AI continuously evaluates and improves its systems to:

* Enhance accuracy and curriculum relevance
* Reduce bias and unsafe outputs
* Improve transparency and user control

Updates to AI models, retrieval systems, and safety measures may occur periodically to reflect advances in technology and educational standards.

*(Placeholder: Insert model update frequency or feedback mechanisms.)*

## Policy Acknowledgement

By accessing or using PressClass AI, users confirm that they understand the role and limitations of AI within the platform and agree to use it responsibly.

PressClass AI is committed to building trustworthy educational technology that enhances learning while respecting the role of educators, institutions, and learners.
