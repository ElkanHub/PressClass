# About PressClass AI

## Mission Statement

At its core, PressClass AI exists to serve one clear mission: **to become the go-to trusted resource and active community platform for teachers and students by streamlining the educational workflow through advanced AI technology**.

Education has always been about people—teachers guiding, students discovering, minds expanding. Yet, over time, the administrative weight of planning, organizing, and managing classroom materials has grown heavier. PressClass AI is built to lift that weight, quietly and efficiently, so educators and learners can reclaim their time, focus, and creative energy.
