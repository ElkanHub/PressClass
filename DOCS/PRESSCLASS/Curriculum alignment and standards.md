# Curriculum Alignment & Standards

## Our Approach to Curriculum Alignment

PressClass AI is designed with one foundational principle in mind: **AI should support educators, not override professional judgment**. The platform is built to function as an intelligent co‑pilot—assisting teachers and students in planning, organizing, and structuring academic content while keeping educators firmly in control of curriculum decisions.

Our AI models are trained on extensive, high‑quality educational data and structured curriculum frameworks. However, PressClass does not treat curriculum alignment as a static checkbox. Instead, it approaches alignment as a **guided, review‑driven process**, where AI accelerates preparation and organization, and educators provide the final validation.

This ensures flexibility, accountability, and respect for local educational authority.

## Primary Focus: Ghanaian Curriculum Standards

At this stage, PressClass AI is primarily focused on **Ghana’s national education system**. The platform has been trained and optimized to support **relevant Ghanaian curriculum frameworks and standards across all pre‑tertiary academic levels**.

These include:

* **Standards‑Based Curriculum (SBC)** for Kindergarten and Primary education
* **Common Core Programme (CCP)** for Junior High School (Basic 7–9)
* **Senior High School curriculum frameworks** as defined and approved by the appropriate national authorities

PressClass AI is structured to reflect:

* Expected learning outcomes
* Core competencies and skills
* Appropriate depth and progression across grade levels

## Academic Levels Supported

PressClass AI supports curriculum alignment across multiple academic stages, including:

* Kindergarten (KG)
* Primary (Basic 1–6)
* Junior High School (Basic 7–9)
* Senior High School (SHS 1–3)

Content generated within the platform can be adapted based on level, subject area, and instructional goals, ensuring relevance and age‑appropriate delivery.

## Additional Standards and Frameworks

While PressClass AI is currently optimized for the Ghanaian education system, the platform is designed to be **extensible**. Support for additional international and regional standards may be introduced over time, such as:

* International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE)
* Common Core State Standards
* Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)
* Other country‑specific or international frameworks

---

## Role of the Educator

PressClass AI does not replace curriculum authorities or professional educators. Teachers remain the **final authority on curriculum compliance, instructional quality, and assessment validity**.

We strongly recommend that:

* All AI‑generated lesson plans be reviewed before classroom use
* Assessments be checked for alignment with official learning objectives
* Content be adapted to match institutional policies and learner needs

This approach preserves academic integrity while maximizing efficiency.

## Continuous Improvement and Updates

Curricula evolve. Educational standards are reviewed, updated, and refined over time. PressClass AI is built to adapt alongside these changes.

As official curriculum frameworks are updated, the platform aims to:

* Incorporate revised standards and competencies
* Adjust content generation logic accordingly
* Maintain consistency with approved national guidelines

## Alignment Disclaimer

PressClass AI provides curriculum‑aware support tools intended to assist educators and learners. **Final responsibility for curriculum alignment and compliance rests with the teacher, school, or educational institution using the platform**.

PressClass AI should be used as a professional aid—not a substitute for official curriculum documentation or institutional oversight.

PressClass AI is committed to building technology that respects educational systems, empowers educators, and aligns with nationally approved standards—starting with Ghana and expanding thoughtfully from there.
