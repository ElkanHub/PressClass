Implementing Notes Generator

The Notes Generator should work just like the Lesson Plan Generator and Assessment Generator in terms of overall workflow. It must have its own dedicated page where users can input details for generating notes, and its own unique result page since the notes layout will differ from both the lesson plan and assessment result pages.
It should use the same GROQ API the other generators are using.

Features of the Notes Generator
Input Fields for the Notes Generator

The notes generator page should have the following inputs:

School Name (optional)

Class

Subject

Strand (Main Topic)

Sub-Strand (Subtopic)

Date/Day (default to today’s date, but editable)

Week of Term + Term (e.g., “Week 3 of Term 2”)

Duration (default 1 hour, with option to adjust)

These inputs will help the API produce clean, structured, curriculum-aligned notes.

Layout of the Notes on the Result Page (Core Components)
Administrative Details

Includes School, Class, Subject, Date/Day, Duration, Week/Term.
This section appears at the top of the notes, clearly identifying the academic details.
(All provided through input fields.)

Topic / Subtopic

States exactly what the notes cover based on the Strand and Sub-strand.
(Provided by the input fields.)

Lesson Summary / Explanation Notes

This is the heart of the generated notes.
It should provide a clear explanation of the topic in a student-friendly structure.
Notes generated must:

Align with curriculum standards

Be simple, accurate, and readable

Follow logical flow (definitions → examples → explanations → diagrams if needed)
(Generated by the API.)

Key Points / Core Concepts

A bullet-form breakdown of the most important ideas students must remember.
(Generated by the API.)

Examples or Illustrations

Provide practical examples, solved problems, short scenarios, or illustrations based on the subject.
(Generated by the API.)

Short Activity / Quick Check Questions

A short formative task that helps students review the notes.
This can include MCQs, true/false, fill-in-the-blanks, or short reasoning questions.
(Generated by the API.)

Extra Reading/More resources {Learn More}

This section is to list a couple of websites and youtube videos where the learner or teacher can find and learn more information about the topic.
(Generated by the API.)

Actions on the Notes Result Page

The result page should allow the teacher to:

Download the notes as PDF

Save the notes to the dashboard

Print the notes

Generate an assessment directly from the notes

This should follow the same asynchronous flow used in the lesson plan

Assessment should be auto-saved to the dashboard

User should receive an in-app notification + a badge on the bell icon (blue or red)

Users must be able to view the saved notes from the dashboard.
There should be a dedicated Notes section with a total notes count at the top (similar to the Assessments section).
All standard CRUD operations should be available for notes.

On the view All page for the notes, the notes should be categorised by the different subjects. So that it will be easy to find the Notes.

Important

Ensure the Notes Generator follows the exact structural flow and security approach used across the app to maintain consistency and safe implementation.
